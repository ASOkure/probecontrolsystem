# Sea Probe Control API

A RESTful API that simulates the navigation of a remotely controlled sea probe on an ocean floor grid. Built using **Java + Spring Boot**, this API is developed using a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach with unit and integration tests.

---

##  Features

- Move the probe forward (`F`) or backward (`B`)
- Rotate left (`L`) or right (`R`)
- Avoid obstacles on the grid
- Stay within grid boundaries
- Track and return all visited coordinates
- Return meaningful errors when blocked
- Clean object-oriented design with layered architecture

---

##  Technologies

- Java 17+
- Spring Boot
- JUnit 5
- Maven
- REST (JSON-based API)

---

##  TDD First Approach

This project was built using a strict **TDD** workflow:

1.  Wrote unit tests before implementing each class (`Position`, `Direction`, `Probe`, `Grid`, `CommandProcessor`)
2.  All logic verified with isolated tests before building REST layers
3.  Added SpringBoot integration tests for end-to-end behavior
4.  Clean commits for each logical step
